# 🎬 Web Scraping: Movie Data Analysis

This project uses **Python** and **BeautifulSoup** to scrape movie-related data from a web page. It extracts and organizes:

- Movie titles and rankings
- Release years
- Durations
- Age ratings (PG, R, etc.)
- Descriptions
- View counts

### Tools Used
- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Requests
- Regular expressions (re)

### 📁 Files
- `web-scraping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all scraping, parsing, and cleaning steps

### 📌 Features
- Handles HTML parsing with tag and class targeting
- Extracts structured text and attributes (e.g., title, aria-label)
- Cleans and formats mixed content like `(1.5M)` into readable view counts
- Splits titles into rankings and names
- Converts raw scraped data into usable lists

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` file
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. See the output cells for printed results and transformations

### 📈 Coming Next
- Convert results into a DataFrame
- Export data to CSV or Excel
- Visualize insights (e.g., views vs. ratings)
